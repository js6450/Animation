        <p>For the After Effects animation assignment, I collaborated with Su He and Ellie Lin.</p>
        <p>When we were putting together the pieces of the animation that we had created, we realized that the fact that we had a very clear story board as well as a color palette really helped bring the animation to uniformity to make it look like a one continuous animation that possibly one person could have made. We set together to make tweeks so that all parts of our animation shared the same style and transitions.</p>
        <p>We also felt that we needed to have sound effects for each of the items animated in the animation, and set down to choose a sound track that would go well with it. We looked through the Free Music Archive website, and found the sound track that gave the animation a very melancholy but beautiful feel to it, which is what we were going for.</p>
        <p>Here is the final version of our animation, The Beauty of Imperfections:</p>
